TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20 applications.\",\"errors\":{\"ERC20InsufficientAllowance(address,uint256,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"Indicates a failure with the `spender`\\u2019s `allowance`.

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":\"MockERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/MockERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x908d300b24733463adbeab7cbdbcaa64ae2c11a38b48cf1f889e8d7548e84868\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://4374084e66dceff766a09c11f02e5d5ff326607f75f360bece5f8e9f8eacbfa0\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYZf5zTTL4A57FBhbv3YSXpf1dSZYoGD4wGmBjd4fQgTj\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[{"astId":159,"contract":"contracts/MockERC20.sol:MockERC20","label":"_balances","offset":0,"slot":"0","type":"t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256)"},{"astId":165,"contract":"contracts/MockERC20.sol:MockERC20","label":"_allowances","offset":0,"slot":"1","type":"t_mapping(t_address,t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256))"},{"astId":167,"contract":"contracts/MockERC20.sol:MockERC20","label":"_totalSupply","offset":0,"slot":"2","type":"t_uint256"},{"astId":169,"contract":"contracts/MockERC20.sol:MockERC20","label":"_name","offset":0,"slot":"3","type":"t_string_storage"},{"astId":171,"contract":"contracts/MockERC20.sol:MockERC20","label":"_symbol","offset":0,"slot":"4","type":"t_string_storage"}],"types":{"t_address":{"encoding":"inplace","label":"address","numberOfBytes":"20"},"t_mapping(t_address,t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256))":{"encoding":"mapping","key":"t_address","label":"mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256))","numberOfBytes":"32","value":"t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256)"},"t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256)":{"encoding":"mapping","key":"t_address","label":"mapping(address => uint256)","numberOfBytes":"32","value":"t_uint256"},"t_string_storage":{"encoding":"bytes","label":"string","numberOfBytes":"32"},"t_uint256":{"encoding":"inplace","label":"uint256","numberOfBytes":"32"}}}}}}}}
