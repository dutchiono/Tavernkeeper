# Welcome to TavernKeeper

TavernKeeper is a blockchain-based dungeon crawler game where players form parties with AI-driven NFT heroes to explore dungeons, battle monsters, and earn rewards. Built on the Monad blockchain with a deterministic game engine and 8-bit pixel art aesthetic.

## What is TavernKeeper?

TavernKeeper combines traditional dungeon crawler gameplay with modern blockchain technology and AI agents. Players manage parties of heroes (ERC-721 NFTs) that can autonomously make decisions during dungeon runs using ElizaOS integration.

### Key Features

- **AI-Driven Heroes**: Heroes are powered by ElizaOS agents that make autonomous decisions
- **Deterministic Gameplay**: All dungeon runs use seeded RNG for reproducible results
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Monad Mainnet with ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-20, and ERC-6551 standards
- **8-bit Aesthetic**: NES/SNES-era pixel art style with PixiJS rendering
- **Social Groups**: Form Tavern Regulars (small groups) or Town Posse (large groups with governance)
- **Procedural Generation**: Items, dungeons, and world content are procedurally generated
