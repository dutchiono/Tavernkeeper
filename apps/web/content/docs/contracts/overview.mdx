# Smart Contracts Overview

TavernKeeper is built on the Monad blockchain using a suite of smart contracts that handle NFTs, tokens, inventory, groups, and game mechanics. All contracts use the UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern for future updates.

## Contract Architecture

### Core Game Contracts

- **Adventurer** (ERC-721): Hero NFTs that players use in the game
- **TavernKeeper** (ERC-721): Special NFTs that can claim free heroes
- **KeepToken** (ERC-20): In-game currency token
- **Inventory** (ERC-1155): Items and equipment that can be equipped to heroes

### Group Contracts

- **TavernRegularsManager**: Small groups (3-10 members) for LP pooling
- **TownPosseManager**: Large groups (10-100+ members) with governance

### Utility Contracts

- **TheCellar**: Central pot system with epoch-based mechanics
- **DungeonGatekeeper**: Controls dungeon access and entry fees
- **ERC6551Registry**: Registry for Token Bound Accounts
- **ERC6551Account**: Implementation for hero TBAs

## Upgradeability

All game contracts use the **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)** pattern:
- Contracts can be upgraded without changing addresses
- Storage layout is preserved
- Allows bug fixes and feature additions
- Maintains user trust (same address)

## Network

- **Current Network**: Monad Mainnet
- **Native Token**: MON
- **Chain ID**: See deployment configuration

## Contract Standards

- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible tokens (heroes, TavernKeepers)
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard (inventory items)
- **ERC-20**: Fungible tokens (KEEP tokens)
- **ERC-6551**: Token Bound Accounts (hero wallets)

## Security Features

- **Ownable**: Owner-only functions for critical operations
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Signature Verification**: Signature-based pricing prevents front-running
- **Nonce System**: Replay protection for transactions

## Contract Addresses

Contract addresses are stored in the contract registry and can be queried from the frontend. See individual contract pages for deployment addresses.
