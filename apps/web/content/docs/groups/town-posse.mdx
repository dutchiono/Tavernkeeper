## Creating a Posse

### Step 1: Create the Posse

1. Navigate to the Town Posse page
2. Click "Create Posse"
3. Enter:
   - Posse name
   - Maximum members (10-100+)
   - Membership type (open or permissioned)
4. Posse is created with you as creator (Gold tier)

### Step 2: Invite Members

**Open Membership:**
- Anyone can join directly
- No approval needed

**Permissioned Membership:**
- Members must request to join
- Creator or approved members can approve
- Better for exclusive groups

## Tier System

### Tiers

- **Bronze**: Entry level (default for new members)
- **Silver**: Mid-tier contribution
- **Gold**: Highest tier (creator starts here)

### Tier Benefits

1. **Voting Power**:
   - Bronze: 1x
   - Silver: 2x
   - Gold: 3x

2. **Fee Distribution**: Tier-weighted shares

3. **Access**: Some features may be tier-gated

### Achieving Tiers

Tiers are based on contribution thresholds:
- Set by contract owner
- Automatic promotion when threshold met
- Can be manually updated by owner

## Governance

### Creating Proposals

Any member can create a proposal:

1. Navigate to governance section
2. Click "Create Proposal"
3. Enter:
   - Description
   - Target contract address
   - Calldata (function call)
4. Proposal is created

### Voting

Members vote during a 7-day period:

1. View active proposals
2. Vote "For" or "Against"
3. Voting power based on tier
4. Can only vote once per proposal

### Execution

If a proposal passes:

1. **Quorum Check**: Must have 50% of total voting power
2. **Majority**: More "For" than "Against"
3. **Execution**: Anyone can execute
4. **Result**: Calldata runs on target contract

### Example Proposals

- Change fee distribution
- Update treasury address
- Modify group settings
- Execute arbitrary contract calls

## Contributing Liquidity

Same mechanics as Tavern Regulars:

1. Approve MON
2. Contribute with tick range
3. 1% tax to pot
4. LP tokens distributed
5. Fees shared (tier-weighted)

## Fee Distribution

Fees distributed same as Tavern Regulars:
- 75% to members (tier-weighted)
- 20% to pot
- 5% to treasury

Higher tier = larger share of fees.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Governance**: Establish proposal guidelines
2. **Active Participation**: Encourage voting
3. **Tier Progression**: Reward active contributors
4. **Communication**: Use Discord/Telegram for coordination
