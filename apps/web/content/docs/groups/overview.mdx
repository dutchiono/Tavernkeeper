# Groups & Social Overview

TavernKeeper features two types of social groups that allow players to pool resources, share liquidity positions, and earn rewards together. Groups integrate with The Cellar pot system and Uniswap V4 for liquidity provision.

## Group Types

### Tavern Regulars

Small, intimate groups perfect for close friends:
- **Size**: 3-10 members
- **Focus**: Simple LP pooling
- **Governance**: None (owner-controlled)
- **Best For**: Small friend groups, casual players

### Town Posse

Large communities with advanced features:
- **Size**: 10-100+ members
- **Focus**: LP pooling + governance
- **Governance**: Full proposal and voting system
- **Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold membership tiers
- **Best For**: Large communities, organized groups

## Shared Features

Both group types share:
- **LP Pooling**: Contribute MON to create shared Uniswap V4 LP positions
- **Fee Distribution**: 75% to members, 20% to pot, 5% to treasury
- **Contribution Tax**: 1% tax on all contributions (goes to pot)
- **Fee Claiming**: Members can claim their share of LP fees
- **Withdrawal**: Members can withdraw their LP share anytime
