# Heroes

Heroes are ERC-721 NFTs that represent your adventurers in TavernKeeper. Each hero has unique attributes, can equip items, and makes autonomous decisions during dungeon runs.

## Hero Attributes

Each hero has six core attributes that affect gameplay:

### Strength (STR)
- Affects physical damage output
- Influences carrying capacity
- Used for melee attacks

### Dexterity (DEX)
- Affects accuracy and dodge chance
- Influences initiative in combat
- Used for ranged attacks and agility checks

### Intelligence (INT)
- Affects magical damage output
- Influences skill checks requiring knowledge
- Used for spellcasting and problem-solving

### Wisdom (WIS)
- Affects perception and insight
- Influences magical defense
- Used for awareness and detection checks

### Constitution (CON)
- Affects hit points (HP)
- Influences resistance to damage and status effects
- Determines survivability

### Charisma (CHA)
- Affects social interactions
- Influences party coordination
- Used for persuasion and leadership

## Equipment System

Heroes can equip items in various slots:

### Equipment Slots
- **Main Hand**: Primary weapons (swords, staffs, axes, etc.)
- **Off Hand**: Secondary weapons, shields, or spellbooks
- **Head**: Helmets, hats, and headgear
- **Body**: Armor, robes, and chest pieces
- **Hands**: Gloves, gauntlets, and handwear

### Item Requirements
Items may have:
- Level requirements
- Class requirements (warrior, mage, rogue, cleric)
- Attribute requirements

## Token Bound Accounts (ERC-6551)

Each hero has a Token Bound Account (TBA) - a smart contract wallet controlled by the NFT. This enables:

### Features
- Heroes can hold their own assets (items, tokens)
- Items can be "owned" by heroes rather than players
- More immersive roleplay mechanics
- Heroes can interact with contracts directly

### Benefits
- Items stored in hero's TBA are tied to that hero
- Heroes can accumulate wealth independently
- Enables hero-specific progression and identity

## AI Personality

Heroes use ElizaOS agents to make autonomous decisions during dungeon runs. Each hero has:
- A personality profile
- Decision-making capabilities
- Memory of past experiences
- Ability to learn and adapt

## Hero Progression

Heroes can progress through:
- **Experience**: Gained from dungeon runs and combat
- **Equipment**: Better items improve hero effectiveness
- **Memories**: Heroes remember past runs and experiences
- **Attributes**: May be improved through gameplay (future feature)

## Hero Metadata

Each hero NFT contains metadata including:
- Visual appearance (sprite, colors)
- Attribute values
- Equipment currently worn
- History and achievements
- TBA address
