# Dungeon Runs

Dungeon runs are deterministic adventures where parties explore procedurally generated dungeons, battle monsters, and complete objectives. All runs use seeded RNG for reproducibility and fairness.

## What is a Dungeon Run?

A dungeon run is a deterministic adventure where:
- Your party explores a procedurally generated dungeon
- Heroes make autonomous decisions via AI agents
- Combat is turn-based with initiative
- Objectives must be completed to win
- Results are deterministic based on the seed

## Deterministic Engine

### Seeded RNG
All dungeon runs use a deterministic random number generator with a seed:
- Same seed = same results
- Runs are reproducible
- Fair and verifiable
- No server-side manipulation possible

### Seed Generation
Seeds are generated from:
- Party composition
- Timestamp
- Dungeon ID
- Random component

## Dungeon Structure

### Levels
Dungeons can have multiple levels (up to 100):
- Each level has multiple rooms
- Deeper levels are more difficult
- Checkpoints at safe zones

### Rooms
Rooms can be different types:
- **Combat**: Contains monsters to fight
- **Treasure**: Contains loot to collect
- **Rest**: Safe zone to recover
- **Boss**: Contains a boss monster
- **Empty**: Exploration room

### Objectives
Dungeons have objectives that must be completed:
- Defeat all monsters
- Reach a specific room
- Collect specific items
- Defeat the boss
- Complete within time limit

## Run Progression

### Starting a Run
1. Party selects a dungeon
2. Run is created with a unique seed
3. Initial dungeon state is generated
4. Heroes are placed at the entrance

### During the Run
- Heroes make autonomous decisions via AI agents
- Turn-based combat occurs
- Rooms are explored
- Objectives are tracked
- Events are logged

### Ending a Run
Runs can end in different ways:
- **Victory**: All objectives completed
- **Defeat**: Party wiped (all heroes defeated)
- **Timeout**: Run exceeded time limit
- **Abandoned**: Party left the dungeon
- **Error**: Technical issue occurred

## AI Agent Decisions

Heroes make autonomous decisions during runs:
- Movement and exploration
- Combat actions (attack, defend, use items)
- Skill checks and interactions
- Party coordination

Decisions are made by ElizaOS agents based on:
- Hero personality
- Current situation
- Party composition
- Past experiences (memory)

## Combat in Dungeons

Combat occurs when parties encounter monsters:
- Turn-based with initiative rolls
- Heroes and monsters take turns
- Actions include attack, defend, use item, skill check
- Damage is calculated deterministically
- Combat ends when one side is defeated

## Loot and Rewards

### Loot Distribution
- Loot is found in treasure rooms and from defeated monsters
- Distributed among party members
- Items are ERC-1155 tokens
- Can be equipped or traded

### Rewards
- **Items**: Procedurally generated equipment
- **KEEP Tokens**: In-game currency
- **Experience**: Hero progression (future)
- **Memories**: Stored in agent memory

## Run Results

### Stored Information
- Complete event log
- Turn-by-turn actions
- Combat results
- Loot obtained
- Final outcome

### Replayability
Runs can be replayed or reviewed:
- View complete event log
- See all decisions made
- Understand outcomes
- Learn from experiences
