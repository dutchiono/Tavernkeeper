# Game Mechanics Overview

TavernKeeper features a comprehensive set of game mechanics that combine traditional RPG elements with blockchain technology and AI-driven gameplay.

## Core Systems

### Heroes System
Heroes are ERC-721 NFTs with unique attributes, equipment slots, and Token Bound Accounts. Each hero can make autonomous decisions during dungeon runs using AI agents.

### Party System
Players form parties of up to 5 heroes to explore dungeons together. Parties can be created, joined via invites, and used to start dungeon runs.

### Dungeon Runs
Deterministic dungeon exploration using seeded RNG. Runs are reproducible, fair, and verifiable. Heroes make autonomous decisions via AI agents.

### Combat System
Turn-based combat with initiative rolls, attacks, damage calculation, and skill checks. Combat is deterministic based on the dungeon seed.

### Items & Loot
Procedurally generated ERC-1155 items with various rarities, stats, and equipment slots. Items can be found as loot, equipped to heroes, or traded.

### World Generation
Hierarchical world generation system creating a rich, interconnected world from cosmic forces down to individual mortals. Includes geography, organizations, and lore.

### AI Agents
ElizaOS-powered agents that make autonomous decisions for heroes during dungeon runs. Agents have personalities, memories, and can learn from experiences.

## Deterministic Engine

All game mechanics use a deterministic engine with seeded random number generation. This ensures:
- Runs are reproducible with the same seed
- Fair and verifiable gameplay
- No server-side manipulation
- Results can be verified on-chain

## Blockchain Integration

Game mechanics are integrated with smart contracts:
- Heroes: ERC-721 NFTs (Adventurer contract)
- Items: ERC-1155 tokens (Inventory contract)
- Currency: ERC-20 KEEP tokens
- Accounts: ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts
