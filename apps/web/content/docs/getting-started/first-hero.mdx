# Your First Hero

Heroes are the core of TavernKeeper gameplay. Each hero is an ERC-721 NFT that can explore dungeons, battle monsters, and earn rewards.

## What is a Hero?

A hero is an Adventurer NFT that represents your character in the game. Each hero has:
- **Unique Attributes**: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Charisma
- **Equipment Slots**: Can equip weapons, armor, and accessories
- **Token Bound Account**: Each hero has an ERC-6551 account that can hold assets
- **AI Personality**: Heroes use ElizaOS agents to make decisions during dungeon runs

## Getting Your First Hero

### Option 1: Mint a New Hero

1. Navigate to the Hero Builder in the game
2. Customize your hero's appearance and attributes
3. Pay the minting fee (signature-based pricing)
4. Your hero NFT will be minted to your wallet

### Option 2: Claim a Free Hero

If you own a TavernKeeper NFT, you may be eligible to claim a free hero:
1. Connect your wallet that holds a TavernKeeper NFT
2. Navigate to the hero minting page
3. Claim your free hero (one per TavernKeeper NFT)

### Option 3: Purchase on Marketplace

You can purchase heroes from other players on the marketplace:
1. Browse available heroes
2. Check their attributes and equipment
3. Purchase with MON or KEEP tokens

## Hero Attributes

Each hero has six core attributes:

- **Strength (STR)**: Affects physical damage and carrying capacity
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Affects accuracy, dodge chance, and initiative
- **Intelligence (INT)**: Affects magical damage and skill checks
- **Wisdom (WIS)**: Affects perception, insight, and magical defense
- **Constitution (CON)**: Affects hit points and resistance to damage
- **Charisma (CHA)**: Affects social interactions and party coordination

## Equipment

Heroes can equip items in various slots:
- **Main Hand**: Weapons (swords, staffs, etc.)
- **Off Hand**: Shields, secondary weapons, or spellbooks
- **Head**: Helmets and hats
- **Body**: Armor and robes
- **Hands**: Gloves and gauntlets
- **Feet**: Boots and shoes

## Token Bound Accounts (ERC-6551)

Each hero has a Token Bound Account (TBA) - a smart contract wallet controlled by the NFT. This allows:
- Heroes to hold their own assets (items, tokens)
- Items to be "owned" by heroes rather than players
- More immersive roleplay and gameplay mechanics
