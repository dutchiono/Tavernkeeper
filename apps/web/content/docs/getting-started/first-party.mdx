# Your First Party

Parties are groups of up to 5 heroes that explore dungeons together. Forming a party is essential for dungeon runs.

## What is a Party?

A party is a group of heroes that can:
- Explore dungeons together
- Battle monsters as a team
- Share loot and rewards
- Coordinate actions during runs

Parties can have up to 5 heroes total. You can create a party with just your own heroes, or invite other players to join.

## Creating a Party

### Step 1: Create the Party

1. Navigate to the Party page in the game
2. Click "Create Party"
3. Select which of your heroes to include (you can add more later)
4. Optionally select a dungeon to target

### Step 2: Invite Others (Optional)

If you want other players to join:
1. Generate an invite code from your party page
2. Share the invite code with friends
3. They can join using the code

### Step 3: Start a Dungeon Run

Once your party has at least one hero (and up to 5):
1. Select a dungeon to explore
2. Click "Start Run"
3. The dungeon run will begin with your party

## Party Status

Parties have different statuses:

- **waiting**: Party is formed but hasn't started a run yet
- **ready**: Party has enough members and is ready to start
- **in_progress**: Party is currently in a dungeon run
- **completed**: Party finished a dungeon run
- **cancelled**: Party was cancelled

## Party Mechanics

### Member Limits

- Minimum: 1 hero (you can solo dungeons)
- Maximum: 5 heroes
- You can leave and rejoin parties freely

### Invites

- Invite codes can be generated for any party
- Codes can have expiration dates
- Codes can have usage limits (default: 10 uses)

### Starting Runs

When a party reaches 5 members and has a dungeon selected, the run may auto-start. Otherwise, the party leader can manually start the run.

## Dungeon Runs

Once a party starts a dungeon run:
- The run uses deterministic seeded RNG
- Heroes make autonomous decisions via AI agents
- Combat is turn-based
- Objectives must be completed to win
- Results are stored and can be reviewed
