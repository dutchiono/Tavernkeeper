# Tavern Regulars

Tavern Regulars are small, intimate groups (3-10 members) designed for close-knit communities. They offer simple LP pooling without the complexity of governance.

## Overview

- **Contract**: TavernRegularsManager
- **Group Size**: 3-10 members
- **Governance**: None
- **Complexity**: Simple

## Creating a Group

### Step 1: Create the Group

1. Navigate to the Tavern Regulars page
2. Click "Create Group"
3. Enter a group name
4. Group is created with you as the first member

### Step 2: Invite Members

1. Share your group ID with friends
2. They can join directly (if under 10 members)
3. No approval needed

## Contributing Liquidity

### How It Works

1. **Approve MON**: Approve MON tokens to the contract
2. **Contribute**: Call `contributeLiquidity()` with:
   - Group ID
   - MON amount
   - Uniswap V4 tick range
3. **Tax Applied**: 1% goes to The Cellar pot
4. **LP Created**: Remaining MON used to create LP position
5. **Shares Distributed**: LP tokens distributed proportionally

### Example

If you contribute 100 MON:
- 1 MON goes to pot (1% tax)
- 99 MON used for LP
- You receive LP tokens proportional to your contribution

## Fee Distribution

When LP positions earn fees:

1. **Owner Tax** (if set): Applied first
2. **Remaining Split**:
   - 75% to members (proportional to LP shares)
   - 20% to The Cellar pot
   - 5% to treasury

### Claiming Fees

Members can claim their share:
1. Navigate to your group
2. Click "Claim Fees"
3. Receive MON and KEEP proportional to your share

## Withdrawing

You can withdraw your LP share anytime:

1. Call `withdrawLiquidity()` with LP token amount
2. Receive MON and KEEP proportional to your share
3. Your membership remains (can contribute again)

## Group Management

### Member Limits

- **Minimum**: 3 members (recommended for meaningful pooling)
- **Maximum**: 10 members (hard limit)
- **Leaving**: Members can leave anytime

### Owner Controls

Group creator (owner) can:
- Set fee distribution percentages
- Set owner tax (0-10%)
- Configure group settings

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 3-5 trusted members
2. **Clear Communication**: Coordinate contributions
3. **Long-term Focus**: 1% tax encourages holding
4. **Regular Claims**: Claim fees periodically
